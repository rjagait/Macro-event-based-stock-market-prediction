    <h1>Macro Event Based Prediction</h1>
   
    <p>For next generation market prediction, our product uses artificial intelligence to make predictions and helps to invest smartly.
    Our model predicts the impact of various macro-events on the stock price and uses this impact to predict the stock price with better accuracy.
    These macro-events help us better understand the market fluctuations and potentially help predict these fluctuations even before they become available on news sites like Thomson Reuters.</p>
